# Real-time sign language recognition
-------------------------
This project focuses on real-time detection of sign language gestures employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms. The system is specifically engineered to interpret hand gestures representing various letters of the alphabet.
Using CNN algorithms, the system identifies and categorizes these movements in real-time. It serves as a primary means of facilitating communication for individuals who use sign language as their primary means of expression. Below is an illustrative example showcasing the functionality of real-time sign language detection.
